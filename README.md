# Guile Cookbook
Inspired by both the [Scheme
Primer](https://files.spritely.institute/papers/scheme-primer.html) by
[The Spritely Institute's](https://spritely.institute) Christine
Lemmer-Webber, and [vindarel's](https://github.com/vindarel) excellent
[Common Lisp Cookbook](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook), I
figured it was high time that Guile Scheme had a single place to find
practical examples of how to do everyday programming tasks in the
language. The Scheme primer is a great introduction, and the Guile
manual is well-written, but I still found I needed a better handoff
between the two!
